/**
 * Object relational query for finding a List, Set, Map or single entity bean.
 * <p>
 * Example: Create the query using the API.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * List<Order> orderList = 
 *   ebeanServer.find(Order.class)
 *     .fetch("customer")
 *     .fetch("details")
 *     .where()
 *       .like("customer.name","rob%")
 *       .gt("orderDate",lastWeek)
 *     .orderBy("customer.id, id desc")
 *     .setMaxRows(50)
 *     .findList();
 *   
 * ...
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example: The same query using the query language
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * String oql = 
 *   	"  find  order "
 *   	+" fetch customer "
 *   	+" fetch details "
 *   	+" where customer.name like :custName and orderDate > :minOrderDate "
 *   	+" order by customer.id, id desc "
 *   	+" limit 50 ";
 *   
 * Query<Order> query = ebeanServer.createQuery(Order.class, oql);
 * query.setParameter("custName", "Rob%");
 * query.setParameter("minOrderDate", lastWeek);
 *   
 * List<Order> orderList = query.findList();
 * ...
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example: Using a named query called "with.cust.and.details"
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * Query<Order> query = ebeanServer.createNamedQuery(Order.class,"with.cust.and.details");
 * query.setParameter("custName", "Rob%");
 * query.setParameter("minOrderDate", lastWeek);
 *   
 * List<Order> orderList = query.findList();
 * ...
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <h3>AutoTune</h3>
 * <p>
 * Ebean has built in support for "AutoTune". This is a mechanism where a query
 * can be automatically tuned based on profiling information that is collected.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is effectively the same as automatically using select() and fetch() to
 * build a query that will fetch all the data required by the application and no
 * more.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is expected that AutoTune will be the default approach for many queries
 * in a system. It is possibly not as useful where the result of a query is sent
 * to a remote client or where there is some requirement for "Read Consistency"
 * guarantees.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Query Language</h3>
 * <p>
 * <b>Partial Objects</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <em>find</em> and <em>fetch</em> clauses support specifying a list of
 * properties to fetch. This results in objects that are "partially populated".
 * If you try to get a property that was not populated a "lazy loading" query
 * will automatically fire and load the rest of the properties of the bean (This
 * is very similar behaviour as a reference object being "lazy loaded").
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Partial objects can be saved just like fully populated objects. If you do
 * this you should remember to include the <em>"Version"</em> property in the
 * initial fetch. If you do not include a version property then optimistic
 * concurrency checking will occur but only include the fetched properties.
 * Refer to "ALL Properties/Columns" mode of Optimistic Concurrency checking.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * [ find  {bean type} [ ( * | {fetch properties} ) ] ]
 * [ fetch {associated bean} [ ( * | {fetch properties} ) ] ]
 * [ where {predicates} ]
 * [ order by {order by properties} ]
 * [ limit {max rows} [ offset {first row} ] ]
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>FIND</b> <b>{bean type}</b> [ ( <i>*</i> | <i>{fetch properties}</i> ) ]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With the find you specify the type of beans to fetch. You can optionally
 * specify a list of properties to fetch. If you do not specify a list of
 * properties ALL the properties for those beans are fetched.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In object graph terms the <em>find</em> clause specifies the type of bean at
 * the root level and the <em>fetch</em> clauses specify the paths of the object
 * graph to populate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>FETCH</b> <b>{associated property}</b> [ ( <i>*</i> | <i>{fetch
 * properties}</i> ) ]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With the fetch you specify the associated property to fetch and populate. The
 * associated property is a OneToOnem, ManyToOne, OneToMany or ManyToMany
 * property. When the query is executed Ebean will fetch the associated data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For fetch of a path we can optionally specify a list of properties to fetch.
 * If you do not specify a list of properties ALL the properties for that bean
 * type are fetched.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>WHERE</b> <b>{list of predicates}</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The list of predicates which are joined by AND OR NOT ( and ). They can
 * include named (or positioned) bind parameters. These parameters will need to
 * be bound by {@link Query#setParameter(String, Object)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>ORDER BY</b> <b>{order by properties}</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The list of properties to order the result. You can include ASC (ascending)
 * and DESC (descending) in the order by clause.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>LIMIT</b> <b>{max rows}</b> [ OFFSET <i>{first row}</i> ]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The limit offset specifies the max rows and first row to fetch. The offset is
 * optional.
 * </p>
 * <h4>Examples of Ebean's Query Language</h4>
 * <p>
 * Find orders fetching all its properties
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * find order
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Find orders fetching all its properties
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * find order (*)
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Find orders fetching its id, shipDate and status properties. Note that the id
 * property is always fetched even if it is not included in the list of fetch
 * properties.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * find order (shipDate, status)
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Find orders with a named bind variable (that will need to be bound via
 * {@link Query#setParameter(String, Object)}).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * find order
 * where customer.name like :custLike
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Find orders and also fetch the customer with a named bind parameter. This
 * will fetch and populate both the order and customer objects.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * find  order
 * fetch customer
 * where customer.id = :custId
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Find orders and also fetch the customer, customer shippingAddress, order
 * details and related product. Note that customer and product objects will be
 * "Partial Objects" with only some of their properties populated. The customer
 * objects will have their id, name and shipping address populated. The product
 * objects (associated with each order detail) will have their id, sku and name
 * populated.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * find  order
 * fetch customer (name)
 * fetch customer.shippingAddress
 * fetch details
 * fetch details.product (sku, name)
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Early parsing of the Query</h3>
 * <p>
 * When you get a Query object from a named query, the query statement has
 * already been parsed. You can then add to that query (add fetch paths, add to
 * the where clause) or override some of its settings (override the order by
 * clause, first rows, max rows).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The thought is that you can use named queries as a 'starting point' and then
 * modify the query to suit specific needs.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Building the Where clause</h3>
 * <p>
 * You can add to the where clause using Expression objects or a simple String.
 * Note that the ExpressionList has methods to add most of the common
 * expressions that you will need.
 * <ul>
 * <li>where(String addToWhereClause)</li>
 * <li>where().add(Expression expression)</li>
 * <li>where().eq(propertyName, value).like(propertyName , value)...</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The full WHERE clause is constructed by appending together
 * <li>original query where clause (Named query or query.setQuery(String oql))</li>
 * <li>clauses added via query.where(String addToWhereClause)</li>
 * <li>clauses added by Expression objects</li>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The above is the order that these are clauses are appended to give the full
 * WHERE clause.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Design Goal</h3>
 * <p>
 * This query language is NOT designed to be a replacement for SQL. It is
 * designed to be a simple way to describe the "Object Graph" you want Ebean to
 * build for you. Each find/fetch represents a node in that "Object Graph" which
 * makes it easy to define for each node which properties you want to fetch.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Once you hit the limits of this language such as wanting aggregate functions
 * (sum, average, min etc) or recursive queries etc you use SQL. Ebean's goal is
 * to make it as easy as possible to use your own SQL to populate entity beans.
 * Refer to {@link RawSql} .
 * </p>
 * 
 * @param <T>
 *          the type of Entity bean this query will fetch.
